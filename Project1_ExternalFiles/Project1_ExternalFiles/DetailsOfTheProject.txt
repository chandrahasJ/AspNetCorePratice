    1) Adding app.UseStaticFiles() or app.UseFileServer(boolean) in Configure Method in Startup.cs will only allow access to files inside wwwroot
    2) Adding services.AddMVC() in ConfigureService(IServiceCollection services) Method
	3) Since we have added the service we can now use the MVC as shown below
		app.UseMVC(routes => {
			routes.MapRoute(
				name : "default",
				template : "{controller=Home}/{Action=Index}/{id?}"
			);
		});
